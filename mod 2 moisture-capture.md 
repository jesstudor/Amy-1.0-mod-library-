Mod 02: Angled Moisture Capture System
​Status: Implemented

​Overview

​This mod uses a specific window angle to capture and redirect moisture during the sea salt evaporation process.
​Technical Features

​Window Angle: The angle is engineered for moisture capture to ensure condensation flows to the collection point.

​Drain Tap: Includes a dedicated drain tap at the lowest point for easy removal of captured liquid.

​Plastic-Free Goal: The entire capture path is designed to avoid any polymer contact, keeping the salt 100% plastic-free.
