Mod 02: Angled Moisture Capture System

​Status: Implemented
​Engineering Use
​High-efficiency passive condensation management.

​Technical Detail
​The window is set at a calculated angle to direct condensation toward the drainage point. This ensures moisture flows away from the salt.

​Safety

​Prevents "rain-back" (condensation falling back into the salt), ensuring the drying process is never interrupted.

​Plastic-Free Goal: The entire capture path is designed to avoid any polymer contact, keeping the salt 100% plastic-free.
