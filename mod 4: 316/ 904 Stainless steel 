Mod 04: 
316L Stainless Steel Framework

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use
​Serves as the primary structural body and pressure vessel for the Amy 1.0 system.
​Technical Detail

​Material: Constructed from 316L Grade Stainless Steel to ensure maximum resistance to salt-air corrosion.

​Integrity: Engineered to maintain a high-mercury vacuum environment, which is essential for the evaporation process.

​Durability: The framework is designed to withstand harsh coastal environments without structural degradation.

​Purity Goal

​The use of high-grade stainless steel ensures that no coatings or plastics are required for rust prevention, maintaining the 100% plastic-free integrity of the internal chamber.

​Progress Check

​By adding this, you have documented the Media (Graphite), the Moisture Capture (Angled Window), the Removal (Drain Tap), and now the Housing (Stainless Body).
