Mod 06: 

Internal Gas-Flow Baffles

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Directs the flow of vaporized moisture from the specialized black graphite pans toward the angled capture window.

​Technical Detail

​Flow Geometry: Specifically positioned internal plates that create a "chimney effect," guiding gas toward the cooling surface.

​Condensation Control: Minimizes turbulence inside the chamber to ensure vapor moves in a predictable path.

​Material Integrity: Constructed from 316L stainless steel to prevent corrosion from high-velocity salt air.

​Purity Goal

​By using mechanical baffles instead of plastic fans, the system maintains a 100% plastic-free environment while accelerating moisture removal.
