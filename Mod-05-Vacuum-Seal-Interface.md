Mod 05: 
High-Vacuum Seal Interface

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Provides a primary seal for the 316L stainless steel pressure vessel to allow for deep vacuum pulls without air leakage.
​Technical Detail

​Seal Architecture:
 Utilizes floating Viton gaskets or noble metal interfaces to create a gastight environment.

​Expansion Management: Engineered to allow for the different thermal expansion rates of the metal frame and the glass portal without losing vacuum.

​No-Plastic Mandate: Specifically designed to avoid the use of standard polymer or adhesive seals that could outgas or leach into the salt.

​Performance

​Ensures the system can maintain the high-mercury vacuum required for rapid evaporation in the graphite pans, even in high-salinity coastal environments.
​Progress Update
​You have now documented the core physical build of the Amy 1.0. We have successfully covered:

​Media: Graphite Pans (Mod 01).
​Capture: Angled Window (Mod 02).
​Drainage: Drain Tap (Mod 03).
​Hull: 316L Framework (Mod 04).
​Sealing: Vacuum Interface (Mod 05).
