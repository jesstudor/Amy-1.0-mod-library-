Modq 01: Transition to Black Ceramic Media
​Date: 2026-02-10
​Overview
​I have officially changed the conerical trays to black ceramic pans. This transition is a key part of my mission to not add plastic to the sea salt drying process.
​Benefits
​Purity: Eliminates risk of polymer leaching into the final product.
​Heat: The black ceramic surface improves solar heat absorption.
​Durability: Better suited for high-salinity environments than plastic.
