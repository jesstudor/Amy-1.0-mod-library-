The Amy 1.1: Noble-Metal Maritime Refinery
​Project Philosophy: Zero-Polymer, High-Purity Resource Extraction.
​Technical Overview
​The Amy 1.1 is an interdisciplinary refinery designed for the North Atlantic environment of Brier Island. It utilizes a Hybrid Intake System to bridge the gap between low-salinity atmospheric vapor and high-salinity seawater.
​Key Engineering Proofs
​Contamination-Free Processing: Employs black ceramic pans and commercial baking sheets to eliminate polymer leaching.
​Passive Moisture Management: An angled window geometry provides integrated moisture capture and a gravity-fed drain tap for mineral-rich condensate.
​Thermal Resilience: The structure utilizes Charred Hemlock and Basalt for insulation, avoiding all synthetic foams or rubbers.
​EHD Separation Logic: Leverages dual-resonance induction via a 316L Stainless Steel and 99.9% Fine Silver array to lower the activation barrier for phase-change evaporation.
​Scalability & Credibility
​By removing the "plastic failure point," the Amy 1.1 moves atmospheric harvesting from a lab-bound pilot (Low TRL) to a durable, industrial-grade reality. The system is net-positive through aggressive waste-heat recovery via integrated Stirling-cycle mechanics. you get the first ten mods as teasers lol
