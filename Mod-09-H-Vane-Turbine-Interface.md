Mod 09: 4-Inch H-Vane Turbine Interface

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Connects the external H-Vane turbine to the primary reactor to pull a passive vacuum using Brier Island wind energy.

​Technical Detail

​Port Diameter: A specialized 4-inch intake port designed to maximize airflow and suction efficiency.

​Mechanical Linkage: Engineered to allow the turbine to spin freely without transferring mechanical vibration to the main 316L stainless steel hull.

​Passive Vacuum: Leverages natural wind speeds to lower the internal boiling point of the brine in the graphite pans, accelerating evaporation.

​Purity Goal
​The interface is constructed entirely of noble metals and glass, ensuring that the vacuum pull remains 100% plastic-free and prevents any polymer contamination from external air sources.
