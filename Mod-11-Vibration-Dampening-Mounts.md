Mod 11: Vibration Dampening Mounts

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Isolates the high-speed vibrations of the 4-Inch H-Vane Turbine from the main Amy 1.0 pressure vessel.

​Technical Detail

​Mechanical Isolation: Specifically designed brackets that decouple the turbine’s motion from the 316L Stainless Steel Framework.

​Structural Longevity: Prevents harmonic resonance that could fatigue the welds or compromise the vacuum seals over time.

​Energy Efficiency: Ensures the turbine spins smoothly, maximizing the passive vacuum pull without losing energy to structural shaking.

​Purity Goal

​These mounts utilize high-density ceramic or metal-spring interfaces rather than standard rubber or plastic dampeners, maintaining the project's strict no-plastic mandate.
