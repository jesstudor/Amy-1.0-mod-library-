Mod 08: Pressure-Release Safety Valve

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Acts as a failsafe to regulate internal pressure and prevent structural stress on the 316L stainless steel hull.

​Technical Detail

​All-Metal Construction: Unlike standard valves that use plastic internal diaphragms, this mod utilizes a stainless steel spring-and-ball mechanism.

​Vacuum Compatibility:
 Engineered to maintain an airtight seal during evaporation while allowing for instant pressure equalization if safety limits are reached.

​Corrosion Resistance: The entire assembly is passivated to survive constant exposure to ionized salt vapor.

​Purity Goal

​By eliminating synthetic rubber or plastic seals within the valve body, the system ensures that even the safety components do not introduce microplastics into the chamber environment.
