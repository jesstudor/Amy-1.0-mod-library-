Mod 10: Noble Contact Points

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Ensures high-conductivity electrical connections for internal components (such as the EHD silver needles) without material degradation.

​Technical Detail

​Material Composition: All internal wiring and contact points are constructed from silver or 316L stainless steel.

​Oxidation Resistance: Specifically designed to avoid copper, preventing the formation of copper oxides that could contaminate the sea salt.

​High-Voltage Stability: Engineered to handle the electrical load required for molecular steering while maintaining a stable connection in a high-salinity environment.

​Purity Goal

​By utilizing noble metal contacts and ceramic insulators, the system avoids the use of standard plastic wire jacketing or polymer connectors. This ensures the internal environment remains 100% plastic-free.
