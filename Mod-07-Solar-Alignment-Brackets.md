Mod 07:
 Solar-Focus Alignment Brackets

​Status: Implemented

​Engineering Use

​Ensures the internal specialized black graphite pans are perfectly aligned with the solar focal point to maximize evaporation rates.

​Technical Detail

​Precision Positioning: Brackets are calibrated to hold the media at the optimal distance from the glass portal.

​Thermal Isolation: Designed to hold the pans securely while minimizing heat transfer to the main stainless steel hull, keeping the heat concentrated on the brine.

​Material: 316L/904L Stainless Steel for lifelong durability in high-salt conditions.

​Purity Goal

​These mechanical alignment brackets replace the need for plastic spacers or adhesive mounts, supporting the 100% plastic-free mandate.
